## 🚀 Quick Start Tutorial

### The Dashboard
Your central command center. 
* **Live Schedule:** Shows your current or upcoming class automatically.
* **Widgets:** Track pending tasks and get science-based study tips.
* **Pomodoro Timer:** A built-in focus timer (25m focus / 5m & 15m break) located at the bottom of the page.
* **Customization:** Go to *Settings > Appearance* to change your **Cover Photo**, **Accent Colour** and **Theme**.

### How to set your Starting GPA
To get an accurate **Cumulative GPA** that includes your previous years of school:
1.  Click the **Settings** (Gear Icon) in the top right.
2.  Select the **"Grading & Classes"** tab.
3.  Enter your **Starting GPA** (your GPA before this semester).
4.  Enter your **Starting Credits** (total credits completed before this semester).

### How is the GPA calculated?
The app uses a weighted formula to combine your history with your current work:
> `((Starting GPA × Starting Credits) + (Current Semester GPA × Current Semester Credits)) ÷ Total Credits`

*Note: Your "Current GPA" updates in real-time as you enter grades for assignments.*


### Setting Up Classes
Navigate to the **Classes Tab**.
1.  Click **"Add New Class"** (at the bottom).
2.  Enter the name, credits, and target grade, link a syllabus, and any other info you choose.
3.  **Subject Icons:** Tap the Icon button to choose from 18 subject-specific icons (Math, Science, Art, etc.).
4.  Set your schedule (e.g., Mon/Wed at 2:30 PM) to power the Live Schedule feature.

### Managing Assignments
Navigate to the **Agenda Tab**.
* **Card View:** Tap any card to expand it. You can enter your grade, view the weight, or add notes.
* **Connect to Class:** When adding an assignment, use the "Class" dropdown to link it to a specific course. This allows the app to calculate your weighted grade automatically.
* **"Aim For" Logic:** Before you enter a grade, the card will tell you exactly what score you need to maintain your target average.
* **Mobile Tip:** The list view is hidden on phones to keep things clean. Use the expanded cards!

* ### Calendar & Exporting
Navigate to the **Schedule Tab**.
* **Navigation:** Use the arrows to switch weeks/months. Toggle between "Week View" (shows classes, assignments, and tasks) and "Month View" (overview that shows assignments due). Navigate too far? Click "Today" to take you back to today's date in one click.
* **Sync to iCal/Google/Outlook:**
    1. Click the **"Export"** button (Calendar Icon top right).
    2. This downloads an `.ics` file containing all your assignments and class times.
    3. Open Google Calendar (or Outlook/Apple Calendar) and go to **Settings > Import**.
    4. Upload the file to see your Aligned Student schedule alongside your personal events!
 
*Note: This calendar export is not automatic, so any updates to your assignments or classes will not show. To update, export a new calendar. 2-way calendar sync is coming up!


### Connecting Tasks to Assignments
While Assignments track your grades, **Tasks** track your effort.
* **The Workflow:** Use the Task Widget on the Dashboard to break down large assignments.
    * *Example:* If you have an assignment named "Final Essay" (Agenda Tab), create tasks like "Find Sources", "Write Outline", and "First Draft" (Dashboard).
* Checking off tasks gives you momentum before the big due date!

### How to Install as an App (PWA)
You don't need the App Store to make this feel native.
* **iPhone (Safari):**
    1. Open the app in Safari.
    2. Tap the **Share** button (bottom center).
    3. Scroll down and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**.
* **Android (Chrome):**
    1. Open the app in Chrome.
    2. Tap the **Three Dots** menu (top right).
    3. Tap **"Add to Home screen"** or **"Install App"**.

*Result: The app will appear on your home screen and launch in full-screen mode without the browser search bar!*

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How is the "Aim For" grade calculated?**
A: The app looks at your **Target Grade** (e.g., 90%) and subtracts the points you've already earned. It then divides the remaining points needed by the total weight of your upcoming assignments.

**Q: Where is my data stored?**
A: Your data is stored securely in **Google Firebase**. It is tied to your login ID. We do not sell or analyze your personal academic data.
